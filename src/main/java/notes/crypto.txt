take a document D from the internet, probably gutenberg

generate N random numbers as S
read the document character by character
    whenever a new character is found, map it to one of the generated random numbers in D, no duplicates ie not two input
    characters map to the same item in in S, and that each unique character in D is mapped to only one item in S
    store this mapping as K

lookup replace every character in D using K.

you have encrypted D with K

Now, generate two such mappings - K1 and K2 , set an arbitrary block size B such that B < D
for every B characters , switch the lookup-replace between K1 and K2 . Now you have done blocks !
