 * lift bigger weights *

 create a database of billion entities.
 let them have a uuid and/or random sequence.
 calculate how long it takes to do these things

 store them in a db. does it work ?
 do you need a db cluster ? will redis do ? how would cassandra do this ?
 do operations on this data set. simple stuff that you do every day but at scale.
    like a billion people voting
    does it work flawlessly ?
    can you hit up on the cap theorem there ?
